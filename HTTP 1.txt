HTTP 1.1HTTP 2DevelopmentIt was developed in the year 1997It was developed in the year 2015compressionIt compress data by itself.It uses HPACK for data compression.Binary protocol A text based protocol uses plain text to encode and transmits data.It works on the binary protocol as a series of binary codes and transmit data rather than plain text.SecurityThe client snds request to a server ,and the server sends a response back to the client.A different underlying protocol called secure remote proyocol 2 (SRP2)
Establish  a secure connectoin between a client and a server.Multiplexing A separate connection is establised for each request and response ,which can add overhead andlatency to the communication process.It allows multiplexing so multiple request and response can be sent over a single connection.Buffer overflowHTTP 1.1 cannot handle buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the lack of sufficient measures.HTTP 2 includes measures to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities .Preformance HTTP 1.1 does not include any in-built features, so the performance it delivers is less efficient. HTTP 2 designed to be more efficient and performant than HTTP 1.1 .This because HTTP 2 includes several features like multiplexing,binary protocol and header compression. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2
