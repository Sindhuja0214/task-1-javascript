Objects & Internal representation in javascript

Java script:
* A java script  object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed,added,and deleted, and but some are read only.
* Objects in the javascript are very much similar to the objects in real-life. We can see lot of objects around us in this real world, each with its set of properties.
* Objects are variables too.but objects can contain many values.
* Object values are written as name : value pairs.
Example:
                          
                 Let person ={ firstName : “ sindhu”, lastName : “tamil”,
                                         age :27, eyeColor : “grey”}
Access object properties:
* objectName . propertyName
* objectName[“ propertyName]
Example:
* person . lastName
* person[“lastName”]
Object Methods:
* Objects can also have methods.
* Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
* Methods are stored in properties as definitions.
Example:
                     
* Var person ={
                          firstName: “ sindhu”,
                          LastName: “tami”,
                          Id             : 0214,
                          fullName : function() {
                              return this. fistName + “ “ + this . lastName;
                           }
                       };
Accessing object Methods:
                           
* objectName.methodName()
* name = person.fullName()
* If u access a method without the() parentheses, it will return function definition.
